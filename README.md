Magical Battle Mocha

Code Challenge:
Much of your tasks as an Instructor at The Iron Yard includes writing sample code which your students will learn from. We'd like you to write some (somewhat) trivial code to evaluate your style on.

What we'll evaluate this criteria on:

1. Adherence to standard <insert language of choice here> style guides
2. Coherency of tests and code
3. Clarity of intent

Our expectation is that this should take you approximately 30 minutes to complete.

What you should turn in:

1. A link to a gist or a github URL. (Gist is fine).
1. Classes and Tests/Specs

## The problem:  Magical Battle

On the battlefield, Unicorns, Wearwolves, Dragons, and T-Rex's do battle. Your job is to model the four animals with a common interface: `battle(other)` and return if the animal wins the battle.

* Unicorns beat Wearwolves and T-Rex's
* Wearwolves beat Dragons
* Dragons beat everything except wearwolves
* T-Rex's (because of their small arms) beat only Wearwolves
* Animals that battle themselves do not win
